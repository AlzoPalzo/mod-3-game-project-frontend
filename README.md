# Key Chain
A mini top down game that lets you travel through a forest. Collect keys and open doors to discover hidden paths and rooms to reach the end of the maze.

Use your arrow keys to move the sprite around the game world. In order to pass through any doors, collect keys and use them to unlock doors. A key will only open one door. After using a key, you will need to find more keys to continue travelling through the maze until you can find the exit.
